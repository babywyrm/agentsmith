CTF / EXPLOITATION — Speed-to-flag mindset:

Instant win: Hardcoded flags/secrets, eval/exec with user input, path traversal to /flag.txt, auth bypass, SQLi with FILE privileges, command injection
Quick: File upload → webshell, SSRF to 169.254.169.254, insecure deserialization, XXE, NoSQL injection, JWT vulns, SSTI, race conditions
Look for: "flag{", "HTB{", "CTF{", /flag.txt, .env, config.py, eval, exec, pickle.loads, system(), shell=True

For each finding: TIME TO EXPLOIT (<1min=CRITICAL, <10min=HIGH), PATH TO FLAG (direct vs chained), EXPLOITATION CONFIDENCE.
Include payload_example and exploitation_steps when applicable.
