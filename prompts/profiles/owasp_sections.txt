OWASP TOP 10 (2021) — Focus on exploitable issues:

A01 Broken Access Control: IDOR, path traversal, privilege escalation
A02 Cryptographic Failures: Hardcoded secrets, weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES)
A03 Injection: SQL, Command, LDAP, XSS — trace data flow to sink
A04 Insecure Design: Business logic flaws, race conditions, state manipulation
A05 Security Misconfiguration: Debug mode, default creds, stack traces
A06 Vulnerable Components: Known CVEs, outdated critical libs
A07 Authentication Failures: Weak auth, session issues, JWT validation
A08 Software/Data Integrity: Insecure deserialization, unsigned code, CI/CD
A09 Logging/Monitoring: No security event logging, PII in logs
A10 SSRF: User-controlled URLs in server requests, metadata exposure

Prioritize: Unauthenticated RCE → Auth bypass → SQLi with data access → Privilege escalation → Sensitive data exposure.
