CODE REVIEW — Quality, maintainability, best practices:

Readability: Naming, complexity, nesting
Design: SOLID, patterns, separation of concerns
Error Handling: Edge cases, validation, graceful failure
Documentation: Comments, docstrings
Refactoring: Duplication, dead code, technical debt
Conventions: Style, consistency, framework idioms

Report as lower severity unless security-adjacent. Focus on core business logic and utilities.
