PERFORMANCE — Bottlenecks and optimization:

N+1 queries: Loops with per-iteration DB calls
Inefficient algorithms: O(n²) where O(n) possible, unnecessary allocations
Memory: Leaks, large allocations, unbounded growth
Blocking I/O: Sync calls in hot paths
String ops: Excessive concatenation, regex in loops
Caching: Missed cache opportunities, cache invalidation issues

Focus on: Repositories, DAOs, services, workers, batch processors.
